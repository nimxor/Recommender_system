# Recommender_system for movies and users

##Introduction
Recommender systems are new types of internet-based software tools,designed to help users find their way through todayâ€™s complex on-line shops and entertainment websites.This project describes a new recommender system,which employs a genetic algorithm to learn personal preferences of users and provide tailored suggestions.

###Crossover Used
**Single point crossover**

###Mutation Used
**Bit flip mutatations**

###Further Improvement
1. A **hybrid model-based movie** recommendation system which utilizes the improved **K-means clustering coupled with genetic algorithms (GAs)**o partition transformed user space.
2. Time can be reduse by using selection processes like 
   1. Tournament selection.
   2. Roulette wheel selection
3. More formal techniques could be investicated for designing the fitness function in a sophisticated way.
